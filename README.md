## AppleCounter

A simple and interactive counter app built with React to track how many apples I need to order each week, based on our personal schedules. Great for practicing React state, props, and component composition.

Features:
- Add or subtract apples
- Reset the count
- Set amount based on 2 different schedules

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
